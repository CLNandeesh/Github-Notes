ADD AND COMMIT
-------------------------
//To create new .git repo
git init

--runs one time per project
--local repository

//Gives current status of git repo and content
git status

--gives status of tracked and untracked files
--tracked: green  Added to statging area
  untracked:red   Not added to satging area

States:
Working directory---git add---->Staging area--git commit---->Local repo ---git push---->Remote repo
[add/modify/delete]

//Adding files to staging area
git add file1.extension file2.extension file3.extension
git add .

//Committing files to local repository
git commit -m "message"

//To get details of commit
git log
--Author/Date/Message/Commit ID/Branch

git log --oneline OR git log --pretty

//Git document 
https://git-scm.com/doc

Note: Keep commit atomic
Keep each commit focus on a single thing

//To redo or update previous commit
to add some new files into previous commit itself

git commit -m "new"  //now u missed some file to add in this commit itself then
git add .   //now this changes to be added to previous commit
git commit --amend
--now editor will be opened, if needed u can add new commit message
or u can just save and close 

//Ignoring files from commit
To not move this to local repository
Ex: api key or cred not moving to repo

Steps:
1. create .gitignore file in the repo
   touch .gitignore
2. add files/folder to be ignored
Ex: .ds_store   git will ignore comiting this file
filename.txt  Ex: secrets.txt  config.properties  git will ignore comiting these file
foldername/      git will ignore comiting this folder
*.log           git will ignore comiting .log extension files 

Website to see which files to be ignored:
https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore

Ex: in python , type python anc click enter u get all files to be ignored in python


GIT BRANCHING
-------------
Head: Pointer pointing to curent branch and latest commit on that branch

//Viewing all the branches
git branch

* and green color indicates current branch

//Creating and switching branch
git branch <branchName>

Note: there must be atleast one commit to create any new branch from other branch

//To switch branch
git switch <branchName>
git checkout <branchName>

Switch to new branch and do commit to see proper changes

//To add and commit 
git commit -a -m "message"

//To create and switch at one go
git switch -c <branchName>

Note: if we do any changes in one branch and tries to switch to
other branch without commiting previous changes then it will throw error
so we need to commit previous changes and switch to other branch 

//Deleting branch
git branch -D <branchName>

Note: user should not be in that branch

//To rename the branch name
Switch to the branch
git branch -m <newBranchName>

MERGING BRANCHES
-----------------
Notes:
We merge branches not commits [all the new commits will be merged by default]
We always merge to the current HEAD branch

//Fast forward merge
Ex: Need to merge feature branch to master branch
1. Switch to master branch 
git switch master
2. Use git merge command to merger feature branch to master branch
git merge feature

//Merge conflict : 
change in same file by 2 users and try to merge
Need to merge feature to master but one additional commit done in master in between
then you get merge conflict
Ex: 
Switch to feature branch---Edit a.txt--Commit
Switch to master---edit a.txt --Commit
Now try to merge feature to master --You get conflict in a.txt file which both had modified

Step to solve:
1. Open the file having conflict and keep either one change or both change 
2. Remove the markers added 
3. Save, add and commit again with new message


BEFORE: 
adada
adad
<<<<<<< HEAD
by master 1
by master 2
=======
by feature 1
by feature 2
>>>>>>> feature

AFTER: kept both user changes
adada
adad
by master 1
by master 2
by feature 1
by feature 2


GIT HUB
-------
Host/Share/Collobotare Repo

//Clonning git repo
To get local copy of existing repo hosted in Gut Hub

git clone <url>
Local copy of a repo will be created in our machine and also .git local repo will be created
Note: 
U should not be in a repository
U can clone any public repo
Need permission to push the repo    

//SSH config 


//Creating repo in github
1. We have already existing repo locally and need to push to new remote repo
Create new repo in github 
Connect ur local repo [add a remote]
Pushup ur changes to github

2. We dont have local repo and to create new repo in github
Create new repo in Github
Clone it down to ur machine
Do some work locally
Push up ur changes to github


Method 1: We have already existing repo locally and need to push to new remote repo
1. Create new repo in git hub
2. Connect local repo with new created repo

//To view is any remote repo existed
git remote -v

//Adding new remote if not added already
git remote add origin <URL>
origin: default name to remote repo

//To push code from local repo to remote repo
git push <remote> <branch name>
<branch name> : Branch we are pushing
local branch that has to be pushed to remote repo

<remote>: where we are pushing

Ex:git push origin master
master to master
To push local master branch commits to remote master branch
All the files in master branch local repo will be pushed to remote repo

Ex:git push origin feature
feature to feature
To push local feature branch commits to remote feature branch 
All the files in feature branch local repo will be pushed to remote repo

Ex: To push local feature branch to remote master branch
feature to master
git push origin feature:master

OR
git push -u origin master  //first time:match local master branch to remote master branch
git push  //later

git push -u origin feature//first time:match local feature branch to remote feature branch
git push  //later

git push -u origin feature:master //first time:match local feature branch to remote master branch
git push  //later

Method 2: We dont have local repo and to create new repo in github
1. Create new repo in github
2. Clone it down to your machine
git clone <URL>
3. Do some work locally
Add and Commit
4. Push up changes to Github
git push origin main //push local main branch to remote main branch
 

//To rename master to main
git branch -M main

//The branch that points on last commit to remote
Branch where last we communicated to github
origin/main
we can move to that branch
git checkout origin/main

Note: when we clone we get only the default branch to our local
git clone
git branch  //master or main
we wont see all the branches present in git hub
we work on main branch and will be connected with remote origin/main branch

//to know about all the remote branches
git branch -r
op:origin/master
origin/puppies

Note: Local main branch will be connected to remote origin/main branch by default

//Suppose we need to work on any specific branch locally not default main branch and that has to be 
connected to same in remotes
Ex: we need to work on puppies branch in local and to be connected to puppies in remote
Steps:
1. CLone repo into local
git clone <URL>
 
2. Get to know all the branches in remote
git branch -r

3. Switch to that branch
git switch <puppies>
now user will be in puppies branch and local puppies branch will be connected to remote origin/puppies branch

4. Do all the changes in that branch, add and commit

5. Push to remote
git origin puppies
local puppies branch changes will be pushed to remote puppies branch


FETCHING AND PULLING
-------------------
To get all updated commits/changes of remote repo to my local we use fetch and pull


State Diagram:

WORKSPACE git add STAGING git commit LOCAL REPO git push REMOTE REPO
REMOTE REPO git fetch LOCAL REPO
REMOTE REPO git pull WORKSPACE

//To fetch all recent commits/changes in repo to local
git fetch <remote>
git status

Ex: git fetch origin
It fetches all the history and branches[changes of all the branches] from remote repo to local repo

//To fetch specific branch from remote to local
git fetch <remote> <branch name>
git status

Ex: git fetch origin master 
fetch all the changes of master branch of remote repo


GIT PULL:
---------
//To retrieve all the changes from remote repo to working directory
git pull =git fetch + git merge

git switch <branch>
git pull <remote>  <branch>

Ex 1: user is in master branch and execute
 git pull origin master
fetch all the latest changes from the remote master branch and merge those changes to current master branch

Ex 2:If we want latest changes of remote repo of feature branch to our local feature branch then 
git switch feature
git pull origin feature


NOTE: 
git log
(HEAD -> feature, origin/feature)  This indicates that current local branch HEAD is pointing is to feature and remote branch is origin/feature
and both are same [changes are same]

NOTE:
There can be merge conflicts when we pull the changes from remote to local repo, if same file changed by 2 colloborators
Ex: a.txt changed by user A, user B also changed a.txt and pushed to repo
now if user A tries to pull those remote changes to local repo then he may face conflicts 

Note: always get all the latest changes [pull] before pushing changes to remote repo

//If you face conflicts when pulling changes 
Steps to solve:
1. Open the file leading the conflicts 
2. Do all changes [kepp one or both changes or add new]
3. Add and commit
4. Push those changes to remote repo [same branch to same branch]
5. Now try to pull 


Ex: 
User A is on feature branch
User B changed c.txt file content and pushed to remote repo
User A changes content of c.txt in local, add and commit
User A try to pull chnages of remote repo before pushing to remote repo his changes as good practise
            //git pull origin feature
        Now you get merge conflicts in c.txt
Solution:
Open c.txt 
Keep either or both changes
Removes decorators
Add and commit the changes 
Push the changes to same branch to remote repo
       //git push origin feature
Now you can do pull
       //git pull origin feature
    Now all the changes from remote feature branch will be moved to local feature branch

MORE ON GITHUB
-------------
//Public vs Private repo
Public:anyone can see and clone that repo
       To push we need coloborator permission

Private: only visible to owners and people having grant access

We can change public to private by moving to setting-option-danger zone

//Adding git hub collaborators
Allow the users to push changes to repo which they have clonned

STeps:
Go to setting
Go to Manage access
CLick on Invite collaborators
Enter their Git buh username
Select that name
Now notification will be sent to that new user
That new user should open his mail and accept invitattion
Now that user can push changes to that repo
We can also delete him if needed from settings

Note:Setting tab will be available in main owner account only

//To rename master to main
git branch -M main

First time flow to be followed
--------------------------------
Lead:
Create new remote repo and add coloborator[testers]

Craete new framework in local and push to remote repo
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "message"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin <url of git repo>
git push -u origin main

Now colaborator can clone that repo to local ,work on it and can push changes
to remote repo
Note: Pull before push 

//README File
Tells about
What the project does
How to run the project
WHy its noteworthy
Who maintains the project
Metadata of the project

Add this while creating the remote repo
